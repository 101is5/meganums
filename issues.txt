duplicate keys in Numbers.jsx:
    I was initializing the array with 6 equal values. This is bad if you want to use indexes.
    It's not the first time I forget index searching functions don't diferentiate equal elements.

non-updating clock:
    In JS, time data fetching rely on instantiating a Date class. I thought I'd instantiate it
    once and then worry about updating time values only later.
    Actually, Date must be instantiaded every new upadate. You can't have Date instantiated
    outside of a function that defines new values, for example. Date will have to be inside that
    function's body.

multiple variables in setState:
    Turns out you can't have it. In class-based components, (this.)state is an object with as many
    variables as you want. In functions, on the other hand, hooks handles variables separately.
    Linting shows nothing, though. You can write more than one variable in a "valueless" object,
    like 
        const [{var1, var2}, setSomthing] = useState('',0)
    and nothing will be warned, as if it was correct. Maybe it is syntactycally . It just doesn't
    do anything.
